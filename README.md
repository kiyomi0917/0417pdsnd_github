Bikeshare Project using Python

Project Overview
This project focuses on Ptyhon’s library usage and simple statistics methods to perform descriptive analysis on the bikeshare data from three major U.S. cities, Chicago, Washington, and New York City - to display information such as example most common days or most common stations.

Program Details
The program takes user input for the city (Chicago, New York, Washington),
month for which the user wants to view data (January～June; including 'none' option),
and day for which the user wants to view data (Monday～Sunday; including  'none' ).

Upon receiving the user input, it asks the user if they want to see 5 rows of data or not.

After the input, the program prints the following details:
●        Most common month
●        Most common day of the week
●        Most common hour of day
●        Most common start station
●        Most common end station
●        Most common trip from start to end
●        Total travel time
●        Average travel time
●        Count of each user type
●        Counts of each gender Types of users by gender
●        Earliest, most recent , most common year of birth

Finally, the user is prompted with the choice of restarting the program or not.
